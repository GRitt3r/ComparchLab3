# ComparchLab3

This lab assignment was to create a register file designed for RISC-V ISA in Verilog. 
The register file is designed with 32 32-bit registers, a 1-32 decoder, and 2 32-1 muxes.
The code, testbench, and simulation screenshots for each module are included.

RegisterFile32Bit.v is the top level module.
